## Summary

This plugin remedies the worst of the ArchivesSpace v1.5.4 Public User Interface (PUI) <title> tag rendering bugs. It currently does not address
similar issues in staff mode (frontend) and is not applicable to the 2.x versions of ArchivesSpace.

## Details

### Breadcrumb tag truncation

ApplicationHelper::truncate() is indescriminate. Failing to account for HTML tags and other elements. This behavior could leave an unclosed element,
leading to strange renderings. If the element is one that does not render in the <body> (e.g., the common <title render="..."> element), the remainder
of the page would be blank.
- Overrides truncate and use the truncate_html gem to perform safe truncation.

### Proper rendering of <title render="italics"> and <title render="doublequote">

MixedContentParser::parse() has code indicating that <title> tags are meant to be handled, but the <title> tags are
stripped out of the document before they can be transformed.

- Override MixedContentParser::parse() to
  - Fix "clean" step to leave "title" tag and its "render" attribute;
  - Add logic to handle render="doublequote"

This works wherever MixedContentParser::parse() is used.

### Render text nodes withing <title> elements in component tree

The text nodes render (i.e., they are visible), but do not respect the value of the "render" attribute (i.e., they are not styled).

NB: It would be more involved to make this work within the JavaScript templating environment used for the component tree.

### Strip mixed content title tags from browser tab/window titles

The tags from ArchivesSpace objects with mixed content (tags) in their titles were displaying in the browser tab 
or window heading from the <html><head><title> element. These are now stripped for any view that has a title pane.
